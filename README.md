## Flicker
A little programming language that I've been working on.

Here's [the documentation for it](https://fractioneater.github.io/flicker), although you won't find much there.

Flicker started out as a tiny language called Lox, the toy language created in the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom, but it has grown a lot since then.

A few things I've added include a more complete standard library, with list, map, and even PRNG data types, and a much nicer way of handling methods. Flicker also is very different from Lox in syntax, with indentation-based blocks instead of curly braces, and linebreaks instead of semicolons.
